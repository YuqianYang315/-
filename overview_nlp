# NLP
## 自然语言处理技术四个维度

* semantic （语义）

* sytax(句子)：句法分析，依存分析

* morphology（单词）：分词，词性，NER

## What are the major open problems in natural language understanding

1. Easy or mostly solved
   * Spam detection
   * Part of Speech Tagging
   * Named Entity Recognition
2. Intermediate or making good progress
   * Sentiment analysis
   * Coreference resolution(指代消减) - Example: "Carter told Mubarak he shouldn't run again." To solve whether "he" is related to "Carter" or "Mubarak"
   * Word sense disambiguation（语义消歧） - Example :
      I need new batteries for my mouse. - "mouse" is ambiguous here.
   * Parsing - the basic problem of parsing sentences
   * Machine Translation - translating sentences from one language to another, best example would be Google translate
   * Information Translation - to take a text as input and represent it in a structured form like a database entries.
    

3.  Hard or still need lot of work
    * Text Summarization - to take input as text document(s) and try to condense them into a summary.
    * Machine dialog system - Example:
      User - I need a flight from New York to London, arriving at 10 pm ?
      System - What day are you leaving?
      User - Tomorrow.
